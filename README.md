# 3D House Project

Modeling a house in 3D with only a home address

##Overview

This project attempts to generate a 3D represenation of a building using geo spatial data. 

##Details

*The project is made in python3.7
*Raster and Vector data of Flanders are used as input data
*Geopunt APIs are used to fetch geographical coordinates as well as shapes/polygons of a particular address.
